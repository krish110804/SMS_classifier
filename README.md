# SMS Classifier

_A machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam)._

---

##  Overview
This project is a lightweight Python-based SMS classifier built using techniques like vectorization, preprocessing, and model evaluation (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.). It allows users to train and test models that can accurately identify spam messages.

Why this matters:
- Helps reduce unwanted messages.

##  Features
- Clean preprocessing pipeline (text cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal)
- Multiple ML algorithms ready for comparison (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest…)
- Easy-to-run Streamlit interface for quick deployment
- Visual comparison of classification results and word frequencies

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Classifier
bash
Copy code
python spamclass.py
Optional: Run with Streamlit
bash
Copy code
streamlit run spamclass.py
Project Structure

Model Comparison & Results
Highlights:

Accuracy scores and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

Visualization of most frequent words in spam vs. ham (via bar plots or word clouds)

Future Work
Deploy classifier with Docker or on a cloud platform

Add more NLP techniques like lemmatization or TF-IDF

Introduce explainability (e.g., SHAP/XAI)

Support language expansion beyond English
